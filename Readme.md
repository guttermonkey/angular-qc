AngularJS QC Distribution Demo
==============================

Front-end AngularJS code for what I think would be useful to the QC team at the office rather than the nasty spreadsheet.  All that's necessary to get it up and running is to tie it to an API backend (either Rails or Node.js would work) and set up a database to back it.

Uses Twitter Bootstrap for the simplistic UI at the moment.

Running the code is simple, just clone the repo and open index.html in your favorite browser (although it's highly unlikely that it will work in IE).
